# Remote Work

A work modality that has grown greatly in Brazil, especially in the IT field. We'll see some points of interest to you that's entering this world now.

## Organization

Working remotely is good, because you don't need to spend hours and more hours with traffic, you can work from anywhere and a lot of companies allow you to do your own work schedule, but is necessary to be aware of a few points:

### Discipline

Probably you'll pass much time working at home, you should be very careful with the separation of an exclusive time to do your activities, because if you stay taking care of your dog, children, etc, this can disrupt your productivity and your results. Set times and let the people around you aware that during working hours you should not be bothered.

### Motivation

You must keep yourself motivated always, because sometimes working with no one around can leave you discouraged, but you must be always prepared for meetings with the team and with your Leader.

### Workplace

Working on the bed or in the couch of the TV room can be very comfortable and relaxing, but is not always the best option. In bed you may fall asleep and in the TV room your relatives, dog, cat, etc can bother you and the TV can take your concentration. Then set up an office, buy a comfortable chair so you can relax, and there's no problem if you eat or drink something during the your work activities as long as this doesn't compromise your activities, goals and results.

### Equipment

Always leave your work equipment organized and ready for use: phone, internet, desktop/notebook must be acessible and moreover tools like Skype and Slack (or any other tool used by the company) must be always updated and ready for use.

## Hiring

If you'll be working for a brazilian company or an affiliate in Brazil, you can work by `CLT` or as a `PJ`. For companies outside Brazil is recommended (even required) to have an employment contract crearly defined to protect you and the company and for you prove the legality and origin of the payments that you'll receive to the government.

## Receiving the payment

The payments must have an big importance and require a special attention, because you'll need to pay taxes related to the amount you receive and even prove the origin and legality of the received values.  

**It's important to check with the company who will be responsible for paying the taxes of transfer and exchange between currencies, etc. Usually these costs are paid by the employed, if that's the case, keep this in mind when setting your salary!**  

Let's see below the two most widely used means of payment:

### Paypal

Safe and efficient tool for receipt and payment values worldwide.

### Swift (Shipment of a bank outside Brazil to your bank in Brazil)

That way you can get a transfer from anywhere in the world at any bank branch. You must send all data regarding the transaction for the company, so they can make a transfer in a bank outside Brazil to a bank in Brazil.  

Another thing we must know is that both banks charge a fee for the service. When the transfer is made outside Brazil, the responsible will pay a fee known as `Issued Payment Order` and when the money arrives in Brazil, the bank branch that will receive the transfer will deduct a certain amount of money before making it available to you. We must also pay attention that depending on the bank the deadline for completing the entire transaction and you be able to withdraw the payment can be up to 3 days.  

**Always check the fees with the banks not to be caught off guard!**  

So that the company can make the transfer, you must send the following information:  

- Full name
- Residential address
- Identification
- Shipping reason
- Bank and Bank Code
- Number of the Bank Branch and the Bank Account
- SWIFT Code (This code refers to the autorized agency that does the currency exchange here in Brazil. You can search for your SWIFT Code [here](http://www.theswiftcodes.com/brazil/))
- Preferably also send the IBAN  

**It's recommended that you contact your bank to ask questions and solve bureaucracies related to SWIFT Code and IBAN!**  

#### IBAN

It's an international identification system for banks and is designed to reduce the risks of transactions and facilitate the communication and processing of them. Widely used in Europe and many USA banks now also accept the IBAN.
